# Word Embedding and LAnguage AI Models - Simple Tutorials

This repository contains implementations of fundamental NLP models, starting from basic word representations to advanced architectures.

## Implemented Models
- **Skip-gram (Word2Vec)**: Learning word embeddings using a neural network.
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: A simple word frequency-based representation.

## Upcoming Implementations
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Understanding how attention works in NLP models.
- **Encoder-Decoder Model**: Building sequence-to-sequence models for tasks like translation.

Stay tuned for more tutorials and improvements!
